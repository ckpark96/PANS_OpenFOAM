# PANS_OpenFOAM
MSc graduation thesis
Built for OpenFOAM v2112
This is PANS solver for f_k fixed in both space and time which is backed in many literature to perform better than f_k varying in space and/or time.

Instructions on how to implement your own turbulence model can be found in a course by Nilsson .H. The link: http://www.tfd.chalmers.se/~hani/kurser/OS_CFD_2020/lectureNotes/implementTurbulenceModel.pdf

Derivation on the PANS equations used will be published as part of thesis in the near future
